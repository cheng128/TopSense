Input and Output for disambiguator_class:
- Input
| - Initialize:
| | - 1. word2pos_defs (i.e. word2pos_defs['bank']['noun'])
| |      -> to fetch candidate senses based on the pos tag
| | - 2. topic_embs, sense_examples_embs 
| |      -> precalculated embedding of topics and sense(include examples)
| | - 3. sbert_model 
| |      -> to do run-time embedding
| | - 4. trained_model_name 
| |      -> to load fine-tuned model
| | - 5. tokenizer_name 
| |      -> to load tokenizer
| | - 6. reserve, sentence_only, reweight, topic_only
|        -> to generate masked sentence and calculate weighted score
| - Run-time: (entry method: predict_and_disambiguate)
| | - 1. sent_tokens
| |      -> tokens in sentence (tokenize by Spacy), used to generate 
| |         masked sentence
| | - 2. input_sentence
| |      -> to calculate similarity score between definition and input sentence
| | - 3. pos_tag
| |      -> to generate masked sentence and fetch candidate senses
|-| - 4. targetword
|        -> use to generate masked sentence and fetch candidate senses
- Output
| | - 1. ranked_senses
| |      -> candidate sense ranked with scores
| | - 2. masked_sent
| |      -> masked sentence (for evaluation result)
|-| - 3. token_scores
         -> predict topics and scores

============================================================================================================

- Evaluation need data:
    
    1. evaluation data -> 100 ~ 300 sentences and answers for evaluation usage, verb evalutaion

- WSD api need data:

    1. word_sense2chdef_level -> display Chinese definition and word level
    2. orig_new -> map category to supergroup, display usage

- The base data that both evaluation and WSD api need:

    1. word2pos_defs.json: word to definition for all POS tag data -> fetch candidate senses
    2. sentence-t5-xl_topic_embs.pickle -> precalculated topic embeddings for disambiguation usage (gpu and cpu version)
    3. sentence-t5-xl_sense_examples_embs.pickle -> precalculated sense embeddings for disambiguation usage (gpu and cpu version)
